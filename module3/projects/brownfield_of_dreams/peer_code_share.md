**Diagramming:**

For the API consumption portions of your project (GitHub and Youtube stories), draw a diagram of how your classes interact. There are many ways you could go about this. If you Google "Class Diagramming", you will probably see very in depth diagrams including "UML" diagrams. You don't need to go as in depth as UML. Your goal is to create a diagram of what classes you have and how they interact.

**Share:**

Share your diagram with a partner. Give them a chance to look through the diagram before you explain it. Don't look at code just yet.

**Discuss:**

With your partner:

* Is the diagram clear? How could you make it more clear?
* Look at the code that goes along with the diagram. Do the two match up?
* Is the code readable?
* If something were to change (for example, we switch from YouTube API to Vimeo), would the code be easy to change? Would it be easy to add on to the code?
* How could you improve your code organization for the API consumption portion of the project? How would this change your diagram?
