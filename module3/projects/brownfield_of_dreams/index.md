## Project Description

You will be building on top of a pre-existing Rails app used for hosting educational programming videos, found [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams).

#### Why?

Up until now you have been building Rails apps from scratch, frequently referred to as greenfield projects. Most Turing grads go on to work on existing code bases, or brownfield projects. Building on top of existing code presents a different set of challenges. Technical debt and the decisions of the past frequently present unanticipated challenges. Understanding how your decisions impact a team is an important part of learning how to write maintainable software. You also rarely have time for a complete rewrite so deciding what to care about and when becomes as important a skill as being able to write code.

## Learning Goals

* Learn to consume a JSON API
* Build an app that authenticates using OAuth
* Make API calls to an authenticated API
* Build on top of brownfield code
* Empathy for developers facing deadlines
* Empathy for teammates that might work with your code in the future (or future you!)
* Prioritize what code is relevant to your immediate task (and ignore the rest)
* Send email from a Rails application
* Configure Continuous Integration using Travis CI
