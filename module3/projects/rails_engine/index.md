You are working for a company developing an E-Commerce Application. Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture, meaning the front and back ends of this application are separate and communicate via APIs. Your job is to expose the data that powers the site through an API that the front end will consume.

## Learning Goals

* Expose an API.
* Use serializers to format json responses
* Test API exposure
* Compose advanced ActiveRecord queries to analyze information stored in SQL databases.
* Write basic SQL statements without the assistance of an ORM.

##### Extension Learning Goals
* Make API calls using javascript `fetch` calls.
* Use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM.

## Project Management

The organization of this project spec is by feature type. However, it is encouraged that you work through a little of each feature type rather than trying to complete an entire feature type before moving to the next. To the degree possible instructors encourage you to use an agile approach to completing this assignment. Furthermore, we encourage you to review the work and develop estimated milestones before you begin. **Any good set of milestones will allow for some slippage before the project is due.**

We *highly* encourage you to have attempted some of the business intelligence queries before that class.

## Rails Driver

[Rails Driver](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver) is the front end of the application. It includes a test suite as well as a front end to test your application. Instructors will use this to determine the completion of your project.

It should be noted that in most professional applications, the front end would not be written in Rails. More likely, a pure front end application would use a Javascript framework such as React. However, in order to make this portion of the project more understandable to BEM3 students we have written it in Rails. The extensions for this project will build on this front end application.
