For this assessment you will be complete a 3 hour independent challenge and present your code to an instructor.

In this assessment you will:

* Consume multiple third party APIs
* Expose an API endpoint
* Build well tested features
* Demonstrate mastery of all parts of the Rails stack
* Demonstrate mastery of Ruby
* Commit every 15 minutes to track your progress (details below)

Post assessment you will:

* Meet with an instructor
* Demo your features in the development environment _No need to deploy to production_
* Review & discuss your tests
* Review & discuss your code quality

## Areas of Knowledge

The intent of this assessment is to demonstrate a solid working understanding of the following:

* Consuming an API
* Exposing an API
* Writing tests that adequately test business value
* Core concepts covered in the previous two Modules
* Demonstrate good code quality using encapsulation and abstraction

In addition, we expect you to:

* Be able to explain all lines of code in your project
* Be able to interpret and implement user stories in a Rails project
* Be able to use external resources in the problem solving process (ie: Google, Docs etc)

## Expectations

* As you work, you *should*:
  * Commit and push your code every 15 minutes.
  * Reference external public resources (ie: Google, Ruby API, etc)
* As you work, you *should not*:
  * Copy code snippets
  * Review old projects for code implementations
  * Seek live support from individuals other than facilitators


#### Note about the commit expectation:

To better follow your progress over the 2 hours we expect that you commit every 15 minutes regardless of where you're at. Be sure to commit anything you may want to talk about later. For example: You get the first implementation working but want to refactor. If you don't commit the first implementation and don't finish the refactor there is no record of your initial solution.

## Evaluation Criteria
